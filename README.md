**Overview of the Project**
Project : LED Blinking with Arduino
**Objective**
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the basic functionality of an Arduino microcontroller by controlling a simple LED using its digital output pins. The project aims to:
Introduce the basics of Arduino programming: Through the LED blinking, users will learn the core concepts of Arduino programming, such as using the pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and delay() functions to control hardware components.

Understand digital outputs: The project helps in understanding how to control digital outputs (in this case, an LED) using an Arduino. The LED will blink on and off at a specified interval, which showcases the use of digital signals (HIGH and LOW) to control electrical devices.

Learn circuit wiring and basic hardware setup: The project allows users to set up a basic circuit with an LED and resistor, learning how to connect an LED to the Arduino's pins and the importance of using resistors to prevent damage to the LED.

Develop foundational skills for more complex projects: This simple project acts as a stepping stone for future projects that involve sensors, motors, and other output devices, providing the foundational knowledge required for more advanced Arduino applications.![Screenshot 2024-12-25 0944421](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a4fe9a0-1658-4d46-8e23-ece673a226dd)

Expected Outcome:**
By completing this project, users will be able to:

Program an Arduino to blink an LED at regular intervals.
Understand basic concepts of digital output, timing, and control logic.
Build simple electronic circuits with basic components like LEDs and resistors.
This project is ideal for beginners to familiarize themselves with Arduino development boards and embedded systems programming.
